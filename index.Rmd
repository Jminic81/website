dplyr allows filtering of dataset columns and rows by using "select" and "filter"" commands.  Output can be arranged in ascending or descending order.  Aggregation, or summarizing, can also be performed.  

The Lahman baseball database will be used to show examples of filtering, arranging and aggregation.  First, import the Lahman and dplyr packages.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

#Filtering Columns and Rows------------------------------------------

The Lahman baseball database can be filtered to display any attributes, for example number of homeruns, for selected teams and years. 

###Example 1

Show homerun totals for the 1927 New York Yankees:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID=='NYA'& yearID==1927)
```

###Example 2

Show all instances where New York Yankee players hit over 40 homeruns:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(HR>=40 & teamID=='NYA')%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)
```

###Example 3

Show all instances where New York Yankee players hit over 40 homeruns but had less than 60 strikeouts:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID, teamID,HR,SO)%>%
  filter(HR>40 & SO>60)
```

#Arranging------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Results can be displayed in ascending or descending order.  The default is ascending order.

###Example 1

Show all instances where players hit >50 in descending order:  

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(HR>50)%>%
  arrange(desc(HR)) 
```

###Example 2

Show all instances of a player striking out less than 10 times but had more than 400 at bats:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,SO, AB)%>%
  filter(SO<10 & AB>=400)%>%
  arrange(SO)
```

###Example 3

Show all instances of a Philly player with >30 HRs between years 1970 and 1979:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID=='PHI' & HR>30 & yearID<=1979 & yearID>=1970)
```

#Aggregating-----------------------------------------------------------------

###Example 1

Show the number of career homeruns by Babe Ruth:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(playerID=='ruthba01')%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(career_HR=sum(HR)) 
```

###Example 2

Show the players that have had greater than or equal to 600 career homeruns in descending order:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(career_HR=sum(HR))%>%
  filter(career_HR>='600')%>%
  arrange(desc(career_HR))
```

###Example 3

Show the players that have had greater than 30 average homerun season totals in descending order:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(HRAvg=mean(HR))%>%
  filter(HRAvg>30)%>%
  arrange(desc(HRAvg))
```

###A Final Example -----------------------------------------------------------------

Since 1970, which players have hit more than 50 homeruns in a single season at least once?

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(yearID>=1970)%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(maxHR=max(HR))%>%
  filter(maxHR>50)%>%
  select(playerID)
```

The End!
